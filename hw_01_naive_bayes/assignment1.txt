Write a Python program that implements the Naive Bayes classifier.
Your program should take as input a dataset file and a set of training
labels in the format given in the example datasets on the course website.
As output your program should produce predicted labels for the test
dataset which are feature vectors whose labels are not given for training. 

Naïve Bayes algorithm
Input:
	1. Data matrix of dimension n by m (n rows and m columns)
	2. Training labels L. Each label li is an integer indicating the class that row i belongs to.

Algorithm:
	1. Training:
	a. Initialize the mean mj of each class to the vector of all 1’s (not 0’s). These are
		pseudocounts to avoid zero variance.
	b. Compute mean mj of each class by adding each datapoint to mj and dividing by
		number of datapoints
	2. Prediction: Assign point x’i to class j if x’i is closest to the mean of class j normalized by
		standard deviation. In other words

		class(xi) = argminj( sum( (x'ik - mjk)/sjk  ) )

		where sjk is the standard deviation of the kth feature (dimension) of class j and mjk and x’ik
		are the kth entry (dimension) of the vectors x’i and mj respectively.
