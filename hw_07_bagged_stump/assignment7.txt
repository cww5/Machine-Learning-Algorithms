Write a Python program to perform bagging on the decision 
stump that you wrote in assignment 6.

The input should be the data file and labels as in previous
assignments. The output is the prediction of test datapoints just
like we did in assignments one through five. 

Your program will create a bootstrapped dataset and then run
your decision stump on it and obtain predictions labels.
It will repeat this a 100 times and output the majority vote of 
the predictions.
