# Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains several Python scripts which were made for my machine learning class. The basic requirement for all of the scripts (except the project) is that we were not allowed to use any machine learning libraries or numpy, which meant that we had to code the algorithms from scratch. This helped me learn more about the algorithms on an in depth level, versus those who simply begin with sklearn. I initialize this repository with the submissions I made during the class, but I will gradually update these to make the code cleaner, and possibly include numpy and other libraries to make this more space efficient. (Numpy arrays can save some memory using types like int32 or int64 versus Python which has overhead for mixed typing.)

## TODO
- [ ] Initialize repo with data sets and submissions made for the class.
- [ ] Clean code.
- [ ] Update code with Numpy.
